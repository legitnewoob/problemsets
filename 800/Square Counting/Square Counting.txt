Luis has a sequence of n+1 integers a1,a2,…,an+1. For each i=1,2,…,n+1 it is guaranteed that 0≤ai<n, or ai=n2. He has calculated the sum of all the elements of the sequence, and called this value s.

Luis has lost his sequence, but he remembers the values of n and s. Can you find the number of elements in the sequence that are equal to n2?

We can show that the answer is unique under the given constraints.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤2⋅104). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and s (1≤n<106, 0≤s≤1018). It is guaranteed that the value of s is a valid sum for some sequence satisfying the above constraints.

Output
For each test case, print one integer — the number of elements in the sequence which are equal to n2.
